                <td>In almost 2 years of activity, I managed to solve over 900 support cases on SharePoint On Premise. At my trainings, there were over 350 users trained on SharePoint 2016 and I’ve created and started trainings on a new tool, SharePoint Online with currently over 150 users trained. I’ve adapted and improved the support and the trainings provided to users on the before mentioned tools in order to better respond to the users’ needs. Also, besides providing users with specific answers I have tried to foresee future cases and come up with helpful procedures. In addition, I’ve replicated the same trainings available for French users in Romania as well, for Romanian speakers.<br>
